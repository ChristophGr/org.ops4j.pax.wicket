Internationally known as "The River Of Gold", Sungei Wang Plaza exudes charm
and popularity both among tourists and the locals. Strategically located
amidst high rises of the Golden Triangle, Sungei Wang Plaza offers visitors
more than 500 retail variety in one shopping haven complete with ample parking
spaces, functional facilities and accessible public transportations.

Incorporated in Malaysia on 16th May 1972 with an authorized share capital of
RM15 million, Sungei Wang Plaza Sdn Bhd is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Landmarks Berhad, a public listed company in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
(KLSE). Opened for business in 1977, this 1.2 million square feet mall consists
of seven shopping levels and three split -level basement parking spaces.

The core venture of Sungei Wang Plaza revolves around the ownership and leasing
of commercial spaces at the Plaza. In view of the comfort of our clients and
visitors, USD 10 million was invested into the renovation and refurbishment of
the retail floors in 1992.

In addition to better facilities and comfort, IT@SungeiWang was established to
provide latest IT solutions through reliable and warm customer services,
besides guaranteed quality products.

The past 28 years recorded a colourful history of success and distinguished
awards for Sungei Wang Plaza. Even though swarm by many challenging
competitors, the road ahead is undeniably bright and undefeated.
